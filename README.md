# Citibike-Module

Analysis: 

We used the Citibike Data from August 2013. 

We first developed maps for both the start and end bike stations. We discovered that theres a slight concentration of tripduration in the central manhattan area. 
There tends to be a slight increase with the end bike stations compared to the start bike stations. My hypothesis is due to possibly the end of the work day. 
I created a filter to find which stations are used with the customer or the subscriber 

After creating the first two maps, I wanted to know more about the people that are using these stations. We first wanted to know the ages of the riders and which usertype were they. 
We then discovered that although most of subscribers that are riding the bikes, customers tends to have a high average tripduration compared to the subscriber. Took a deep dive of the gender of the riders as well. 

I orignally thought there would be an increase with rides on the weekend, however; we saw there was a decrease with rides on the weekend and an increase once Monday hit

Lastly, wanted to find a corrleation of which bikeids have the highest tripduration to understand which bike station need to have more attention. Rides vary with the day of the week as well.
